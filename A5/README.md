# Assignment A5 – Reflect

## (As a group) summary of the feedback you received on your tutorial

Feedback

Group 46:
-	It can be used as soon as there is an IFC file to estimate the project cost. How does the price database “read” the modeled objects. It generates the general average cost of the project.
-	The menu is user-friendly.
-	Really useful to compare different options for the same element.
-	Can be added for price analysis.

Group 48: 
-	Great that it’s possible to adjust your inputs while the code is running, and that you don’t have to load/run the script every time you want to make an adjustment.
-	Nicely formatted menu when using the code, nice ability to update prices while using the tool.
-	The base area calculations seem to be set up robustly, which is cool. Prioritization is awesome. The fact that the base input is only an ARCH .Ifc model is awesome too!
-	Love the menu!
-	It would be nice to export the data in a way, to use it later, and to document it.

Group 49: 
-	The menu provides a nice overview of the functions of the tool. 
-	Customizability is nice, which shows flexibility to edit for different types of parameters. 
-	Good sanity check – for budgeting, and quick way to mock op tools for a rapid overview. 

### did the tool address the use case you identified?

### What stage does the tool you created work in Advanced Building Design? ( Stage A, B, C and/ or D).
Mainly Stage B (Early Design).
As soon as you have a basic IFC model, the tool gives a clear overview and helps compare scenarios. It’s great for early decision-making, especially if the budget is a concern.

It can also be used later for comparisons, but it’s not intended for detailed final validation; it’s more of a rapid estimation and overview tool.

## Your learning experience for the concept you focused on.
At the beginning of the course, I had some coding experience, but not in this setup. I was used to working in PyCharm, so switching to Visual Studio Code and working directly with IFC files was new to me. Just getting IFC files to load and understanding how the data was structured was a big learning curve. But over time, things started clicking, and I realised how much potential there actually is in using the IFC data instead of doing everything manually in a 3D model.

By the end of the course, I’m far more confident reading IFCs and understanding how to extract information from them. Scripting is still challenging for me, but I’m getting better and I actually understand what the code is doing now instead of just “hoping it works.” Blender/Bonsai is still not my favourite tool — it feels clunky and not very intuitive — but GitHub, VS Code, and IfcOpenShell feel completely manageable.

I definitely moved up this curve — especially in IFC understanding and recognising what you can automate instead of doing it manually.

### What else do you still need to learn?
Stronger coding skills — I want to be able to write more of the scripts myself instead of relying on others or AI.

More practice using IfcOpenShell confidently.

Better understanding of model checking workflows.

Still a lot to learn about combining geometry + properties correctly.

### How you might use OpenBIM in the future?

OpenBIM makes workflows more transparent and efficient. Instead of endless meetings and emails just to exchange information, everyone can work from the same model. I see OpenBIM being relevant for:

Early-stage cost estimation

LCA and material calculations

Extracting areas/volumes for installations

Faster decision-making in design

Avoiding misunderstandings between disciplines

It’s something I expect will only grow in importance as the industry moves toward more integrated workflows.

## Your process of developing the tutorial
### Did the process of the course enable you to answer or define questions that you might need later for thesis?

The Markdown explanation of the code helped a lot — writing things out forced me to understand the structure and what each part of the script actually did. Watching other groups’ tutorials also opened my eyes to other possibilities. I’m not sure it directly defined thesis questions, but it definitely broadened my sense of what you can do with OpenBIM.

### Would you have preferred to have been given less choice in the use cases?

No, the freedom worked fine. The BPMN diagrams helped give structure and an overview, so even someone who isn’t the strongest coder can understand the process and contribute. The openness made it easier to shape the tool in a direction that made sense for us.

### Was the number of tools for the course ok?

Honestly, it is a lot of tools:

Blender/Bonsai — powerful but not user-friendly; easily confusing.

IfcOpenShell — essential, makes sense.

GitHub — relevant and very useful.

IDS — I struggled with understanding why the format needs to be this way; could also be handled in the script.

Python — necessary.

VS Code — great platform, easy to use.

It’s a lot to download and understand when several of the tools are new. But I’m not sure what I would remove either.
