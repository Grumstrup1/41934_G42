## (As a group) Summary of the feedback you received on your tutorial

### Feedback

Group 46:
-	It can be used as soon as there is an IFC file to estimate the project cost. How does the price database “read” the modeled objects. It generates the general average cost of the project.
-	The menu is user-friendly.
-	Really useful to compare different options for the same element.
-	Can be added for price analysis.

Group 48: 
-	Great that it’s possible to adjust your inputs while the code is running, and that you don’t have to load/run the script every time you want to make an adjustment.
-	Nicely formatted menu when using the code, nice ability to update prices while using the tool.
-	The base area calculations seem to be set up robustly, which is cool. Prioritization is awesome. The fact that the base input is only an ARCH .Ifc model is awesome too!
-	Love the menu!
-	It would be nice to export the data in a way, to use it later, and to document it.

Group 49: 
-	The menu provides a nice overview of the functions of the tool. 
-	Customizability is nice, which shows flexibility to edit for different types of parameters. 
-	Good sanity check – for budgeting, and quick way to mock op tools for a rapid overview. 

### did the tool address the use case you identified?

### What stage does the tool you created work in Advanced Building Design? ( Stage A, B, C and/ or D).
Mainly Stage B (Early Design).
As soon as you have a basic IFC model, the tool gives a clear overview and helps compare scenarios. It’s great for early decision-making, especially if the budget is a concern.

It can also be used later for comparisons, but it’s not intended for detailed final validation; it’s more of a rapid estimation and overview tool.

## Your learning experience for the concept you focused on.
At the start of the course, familiarity with scripting and working with IFC data was limited. Working in Visual Studio Code and loading models correctly and understanding how the data was organised was initially challenging, but this improved steadily during the course.

A main learning point was acknowledging how much information can be extracted directly from the model instead of relying on manual calculations or on cheking on 3D models. This made the process more efficient and provided a clearer understanding of how IFC data supports automation.

By the end of the course, I feel much more confident reading IFC models and identifying where relevant data lives. Scripting is still difficult for me, but I’m getting better at understanding what the code is doing and adjusting. Blender/Bonsai still isn’t something I find intuitive, and it slows me down more than it helps, but I can navigate it if needed. GitHub, Visual Studio Code, and IfcOpenShell feel manageable and familiar, and I actually enjoy working in that setup now.

### What else do you still need to learn?
The main thing I want to improve is my coding ability. In my group, I was probably the least experienced coder, which meant I focused more on descriptions and checking functionality than writing the script myself. I want to be able to write more of the code independently rather than leaning on others or AI support.

I also want to improve my model-checking skills and get more comfortable combining IFC information with Python tools. There is a lot of potential in this area, to improve a lot of processes.

### How you might use OpenBIM in the future?
I see OpenBIM playing a bug role in making workflows more transparent and collaborative. Right now, much of the industry still relies on sending files back and forth, meetings, and aligning manually. With OpenBIM, much of that could be streamlined. Having a shared model that everyone can draw information from reduces misunderstandings and helps teams stay aligned.

I think OpenBIM will be particularly useful in early-stage cost estimation, LCA workflows, extracting areas and volumes for installations, and supporting design decisions with data. It feels like something that will become more and more essential as the industry evolves.

## Your process of developing the tutorial
Writing the tutorial helped clarify the structure of the script and how the data was handled. Documenting the workflow made it easier to understand.
Reviewing other tutorials provided insight into alternative approaches and how other problems could be solved more efficiently.

I’m not sure the process directly answered thesis questions for me, but it expanded my sense of what’s possible with IFC-based workflows.

I didn’t feel that the freedom in use cases was a problem. The BPMN diagrams and guidance gave enough structure to understand what the tool needed to achieve, and the openness allowed us to shape our solution in a way that matched our skills and interests.

Regarding the number of tools, it is definitely a lot to take in. Blender/Bonsai is complicated and not very user-friendly; it can easily confuse new users. IfcOpenShell is essential and makes sense to include. GitHub is very relevant and useful in a course like this. IDS was conceptually relevant but harder to implement, but it felt like some of the same logic could have been built directly into the script. Python and Visual Studio Code fit naturally into the workflow. Overall, it’s a big toolchain to learn, but not necessarily one I would cut down drastically; it just requires time to get comfortable with.

## Your future for Advanced use of OpenBIM
I might use OpenBIM in my thesis, depending on the topic I choose. I haven’t decided yet, but if the thesis involves an example with design, calculations, or analysing alternatives, using IFC data would be smart. Being able to extract data and automate parts of the workflow would support the project well.

I might also use OpenBIM in my professional life within the next 10 years — it depends on the job, but I think the industry is moving in that direction, and it should. Not in my current role, but very possible later.

## Wrap up
Across A1–A5, I learned about the many possibilities in IFC models. If I had taken this course before Advanced Building Design, I would have used the data far more and made decisions more intelligently.

What I take with me is the understanding that data extraction, scripting, and automation can really support design and argumentation. It makes workflows smarter and decisions stronger. This course definitely shifted the way I look at BIM data — from something static to something you can actively use.

## Your learning experience for the concept you focused on.
-	Identify your own level at the beginning of this course and where you ended
My role was analyst throughout the course, but I took part in some BIM management meetings to bring the focus area together.

-	What else do you still need to learn?


-	How you might use OpenBIM in the future?
To facilitate BIM management and cooperation in future courses or at work.


## Your process of developing the tutorial
-	Did the process of the course enable you to answer or define questions that you might need later for thesis? 
Not for my thesis, but it was nice to get a chance to explore cost estimation and make a tool that I would actually use, say, if I was to go through the Advanced Building Design course again.

-	Would you have preferred to have been given less choice in the use cases?
We didn’t use any provided use case examples, and I enjoyed the freedom to do what we wanted. 

-	Was the number of tools for the course ok - should we have more or less? - if so which ones would you leave out?
As we were able to find all the tools we needed for the project we set out to complete, the overall toolset felt sufficient. There were some tools we didn’t use, but I think having a broad spectrum available is beneficial, as it accommodates different project types and working approaches.

## Your future for Advanced use of OpenBIM
-	are you likely to use OpenBIM tools in your thesis?
It’s a possibility. My starting point is that I want to produce something useful or engage in something that refines a useful skill, both criteria of which OpenBIM could work with.

-	are you likely to use OpenBIM tools in your professional life in the next 10 years?
It’s not something I’m actively pursuing, but not something I’d be opposed to.


## (Individual) Wrap up
-	conclude the journey through A1-A5

We began with the ambition to create something we’d use ourselves. Looking back at the Advanced Building Design course and our experience as project managers, cost estimation immediately came to mind - It was tedious, time-consuming, and often felt unnecessarily inefficient for something that was ultimately meant to produce only a rough cost estimate.

To meet the criteria of this course, we set out to check claims related to quantities and cost estimation of architectural elements. Not deviating from checking claims, we made the tool also serve as a quick and accessible cost-overview tool, with reduced need for error diagnosing, as it works around some of the issues we encountered with traditional cost estimation.

Looking back, I think we achieved our initial goal: we built a tool we would use if we were to retake the Advanced Building Design course. To be clear, it is not a replacement for traditional cost estimation, which remains likely more realistic, but it is very useful during the design phase for assessing economic performance and informing design decisions. In our tests, the time required for error diagnosis was minimal, though more extensive testing would likely introduce additional cases requiring attention.
