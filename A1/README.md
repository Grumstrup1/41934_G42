## Focus Area  
Our project is within the overall theme **"Build"**, with a specific focus on **cost estimation**.  

## Claim Under Review  
We are examining the claim that the project requires **330 windows** and that the stated unit price of **18,005.6 DKK per window** is accurate and realistic.  

## Report Reference  
- Report: *25-16-D-PM*  
- Page: 64  

## Script Description  
The script (`A1.ipynb`) analyzes the cost estimation of windows by checking whether the reported number of windows is correct and by assessing the plausibility of the stated unit price. It does this by extracting the relevant values from the report data, comparing them to the stated figures, and performing basic calculations to test the realism of the price per window.
